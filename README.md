# FoodOrder-Project
 Throughout the Internship program, we focused on creating a comprehensive, real-world application: a Food Delivery Application (akin to a Swiggy clone). This project was designed to simulate a professional development environment, incorporating a variety of advanced technologies and development practices.
 
 **Technologies Used:**
 
 1) **Frontend:** Built with *React.js*, which was used to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. React's component-based architecture facilitated the development of reusable UI elements and streamlined state management.
 2) **Backend:** Developed using *Express.js* on *Node.js*, which managed server-side logic, handled HTTP requests, and interacted with the database. Express.js simplified routing and middleware implementation, enabling efficient request handling and data processing.
 3) **Database:** Utilized *MongoDB* to store and manage data related to users, restaurants, menus, and orders. MongoDBâ€™s flexible schema allowed for easy adjustments as the project evolved.   - *Integration:* Employed a combination of these technologies to ensure seamless communication between the front end and back end, delivering a cohesive user experience

**Project Highlights:**

1) *User Authentication:* Implemented secure user registration and login functionality, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their orders.
2) *Restaurant and Menu Management:* Developed features to list restaurants, display menus, and filter options based on user preferences.
3) *Order Processing:* Enabled users to place orders, track delivery status in real-time, and receive notifications about order updates.
4) *Responsive Design:* Ensured that the application provided a consistent and engaging experience across

The *Food Delivery Application* includes the following key functionalities:

1) **Display Restaurants on Home Page:** Users can view a list of restaurants available for ordering, presented on the homepage with options to browse and select.
2) **Search Restaurants:** A search feature allows users to quickly find specific restaurants based on their name or cuisine.
3) **Distinct Menus for Each Restaurant:** Each restaurant has its own unique menu, displaying available dishes with details and prices.
4) **User Authentication:** Users can create an account or log in to access personalized features, with a secure registration and login process.
5) **Forgot Password Option:** Provides a way for users to recover or reset their passwords if they forget them.
6) **Shopping Cart:** Stores items that users have selected for ordering, allowing them to review and modify their cart before checkout.
7) **Payment Processing:** Enables users to proceed with payment for their orders, integrating a secure payment gateway.
8) **Order Tracking:** Users can view their current and past orders, including status updates and order details.
9) **Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profile information, including personal details and preferences.
